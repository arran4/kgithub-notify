## Code Structure & Ordering

To maintain consistency and reduce merge conflicts, please follow this ordering for class members in `.cpp` files:

1.  **Includes** (grouped by library/module)
2.  **Constants / Static Helpers**
3.  **Constructor / Destructor**
4.  **Public Methods**
5.  **Slots** (grouped by functionality: Tray, List, Toolbar, etc.)
6.  **Private Helpers** (Setup, Logic)

In header files (`.h`), group declarations similarly and use comments to separate sections.

## Never Nest Principle

Avoid deep nesting of `if/else` blocks. Use guard clauses (early returns) to handle edge cases and error conditions first. This makes the "happy path" of the function less indented and easier to read.

## Function Size & Complexity

Break down large functions into smaller, single-purpose helper functions. This improves readability and makes the code easier to test and maintain.
